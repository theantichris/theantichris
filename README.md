## Hey, y'all

I'm Christopher. I'm a former software engineer now leader and pretty ok guy. I love making people's lives (including mine) better. That is what got me into computers and coding when I was 12.

In 2020, I transferred that same passion into people leadership, finding a new way to make people's lives better.

I have 30+ years experience working in software both professionally and as a hobby.

## Personal Life

I live in Knoxville, TN with my wife, our 3 kids, our dog, and our cat. I love to read, swim, be in nature, play video games, and ride my motorcycle. I don't live leaving my house.
