### Hi there, I'm Christopher ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software development lead in Knoxville, TN. I have over 16 years of experience creating large SaaS and internal products for various industries.

Most recently, I lead an incredible team that went from knowing nothing about blockchain to launching a [cryptocurrency exchange](https://amplifyexchange.com) in less than a year.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [a static site generator in Go](https://github.com/theantichris/site-generator)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Elixir
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything interesting and challenging
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my motorcycle :D
